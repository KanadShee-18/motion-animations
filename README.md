## 🎬 Reusable Motion & Animation Components

### A curated collection of modular animation components built with motion.dev & React ⚛️ — crafted for clean code, reusability, and smooth UI ✨.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- This repo contains animation utilities and ready-to-use motion components covering:

- 🧲 Simple Animations — Effortlessly animate x, y, scale, opacity, and more.

- 🧩 Reusable Variants — Define animation variants once, reuse across components.

- 🎯 Layout Animations — Smooth transitions using layoutId for shared layout motion.

- 🌀 Exit Animations — Animate elements out with AnimatePresence for clean unmounting.

- 🧠 Motion Hooks — Use useAnimate, usePresence, and other hooks for dynamic logic-driven animations.

- 🎞️ Animation Sequences — Timeline-based AnimationSequence support for chained motion.

- 🖱️ Hover & Tap Effects — Predefined whileHover, whileTap props to add interactivity with ease.

-- 🧱 Composed Motion Components — Custom wrappers around motion.div, motion.button, etc., with default props and themes.
